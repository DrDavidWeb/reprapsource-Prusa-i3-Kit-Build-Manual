##Tools needed:
Soldering iron  
Wire cutter  
Wire stripper  

##Parts:  
[<img src="Prev/IMG_0425.JPG">](Large/IMG_0425.JPG)  
Heatbed
Red & black silicone wires (1,5sq mm) (The thick ones in the clear plastic bag.)

##To Do:
[<img src="Prev/IMG_0428.JPG">](Large/IMG_0428.JPG)  
[<img src="Prev/IMG_0429.JPG">](Large/IMG_0429.JPG)  
1. Strip one end of each heatbed cable, twist the strands and tin it. (Strip the other end of each cable and twist the strands only.)  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0434.JPG">](Large/IMG_0434.JPG)  
2. Tin the pads of the heatbed by heating them and applying some solder.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0432.JPG">](Large/IMG_0432.JPG)    
3. To connect the cables, place the cable ends on the tinned pads and apply heat. (Add additional solder if necessary)  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0436.JPG">](Large/IMG_0436.JPG)  
4. Make sure the cable is firmly attached to pad before removing heat. After removing the heat, hold the cable in place as it will take several seconds for the solder to cool.  
5. Put the heatbed aside.

**WARNING:** Do not tin any cables that are screwed to the electronics! This will result in poor connections and is dangerous.
 
#Solder Hotend  
##Tools needed:

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0477.JPG">](Large/IMG_0477.JPG)  
[<img src="Prev/IMG_0478.JPG">](Large/IMG_0478.JPG)    
4. Twist one end of the thermistor connection cable around the exposed part of the thermistor leg and solder it in place. Make sure to make the twist close enough to the thermistor that the tubing cannot move.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0479.JPG">](Large/IMG_0479.JPG)  
5. Repeat with the other cable end and the other thermistor leg.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0481.JPG">](Large/IMG_0481.JPG)  
6. Cut off a short strip of polyimide tape and wrap it around each of the solder joints several times.  
7. Tape the two polyimide tape covered joints together.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0469.JPG">](Large/IMG_0469.JPG)  
8. Proceed similar with the power resistor. Strip the ends of the silicone wire and twist the strands.  
9. Cut two short lengths of the big tubing and slide them onto the power resistor legs, leaving about a cm on each leg uncovered.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0470.JPG">](Large/IMG_0470.JPG)  
[<img src="Prev/IMG_0471.JPG">](Large/IMG_0471.JPG)  
10. Twist one end of the silicone cable around the exposed part of the power resistor leg and solder it in place. Make sure to make the twist close enough, so that the tubing cannot move.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0472.JPG">](Large/IMG_0472.JPG)  
11. Push the resistor in the hotend.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0473.JPG">](Large/IMG_0473.JPG)  
12. Repeat with the other wire and the other resistor leg.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0482.JPG">](Large/IMG_0482.JPG)  
13. Place the thermistor in the hole at the hotend.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0484.JPG">](Large/IMG_0484.JPG)  
14. Cut off a short strip of polyimide tape and wrap it around each of the solder joints several times.  
15. Use a strip of polyimide tape to secure the thermistor to the hotend. Wrap around several times, but make sure to keep the nozzle clear. (Do not economise with the polyimide tape.) It is important, that the thermistor is kept in place!  
16.  Use a polyimide tape to attach the thermistor legs to the hotend and create a strain-relief by the way.  
17. Bend resistor legs along the body.

9. Now you need 16 M8 nuts and washers, the corner pieces and the short rods.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0508.JPG">](Large/IMG_0508.JPG)  
10. Attach the corner pieces similar to the motor holder/drivetrain, so that each piece is wrapped in washers and then in nuts. (The upper rod fitting of the corner pieces are open on one side and should face in one direction. For the motor holder the opening should face into the direction of motor connection points.)

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0515.JPG">](Large/IMG_0515.JPG)  
11. Adjust the distance between the corner pieces. 11,5 cm is a good value to go with. It is important to keep the distance exactly even for the two end segements of the  Y-axis you now have created. You want your Y-axis to be square.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0510.JPG">](Large/IMG_0510.JPG)  
12. Take the two long threaded M10 rods, 8 M10 nuts and washers.

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0525.JPG">](Large/IMG_0525.JPG)  
17. Use to wrenches and tighten all inner and outer nuts against the printed parts. (Make sure to keep the distances you measured.)  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0520.JPG">](Large/IMG_0520.JPG)  
[<img src="Prev/IMG_0521.JPG">](Large/IMG_0521.JPG)  
18. Attach the drivetrain segment on the other side of your rods and slide them in. Attach the threaded rods with a washer and a nut.  
19. Use two 624 bearings, a M4 bolt and nut to attach an idler bearing to the drivetrain. Use a second nut to counter the first nut.  

**WARNING:** The smooth rods sit pretty tight in their openings an it is important to slide them in. Do not push them in from the top! This could damage the printed partrs seriously.

##To Do:
[<img src="Prev/Frame_01.JPG">](Large/Frame_01.JPG)  
Position of all frame screws.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0576.JPG">](Large/IMG_0576.JPG)  
1. Take two of the 450mm panels and put them edge to edge on a flat surface, forming a corner.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0577.JPG">](Large/IMG_0577.JPG)  
2. Have a friend or a clamp hold them in place and drill through one into the center of the other, about 2,5cm (1 in) from the end. (Check this position before drilling to avoid a conflict Z-axis top brackets!)   
3. Make super-sure the panels line up when you drill.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0578.JPG">](Large/IMG_0578.JPG)  
4. Countersink the hole on the flat side and add a screw. Make sure the edges line up.  
5. Repeat on the other end, again about 2.5cm (1 in) from the edge and in the middle.  
6. Take a second pair of panels and repeat step 1-5.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0579.JPG">](Large/IMG_0579.JPG)  
7. Well done - you finished both sides of the frame  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0583.JPG">](Large/IMG_0583.JPG)  
8. Orient the two sides so that the screws point TO THE SIDE in both panels.  
9. Place the corners approximately 450mm apart (inside to inside) and place a 3mm spacer in each one.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0584.JPG">](Large/IMG_0584.JPG)  
10. Place a 450mm panel between them. (This will be the bottom of the frame.)  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0585.JPG">](Large/IMG_0585.JPG)  
11. Drill into the middle of the panel from the front, countersink and add a screw. Make sure the spacers don't move around when you drill. You want the bottom panel to be  flat and 3mm off the table.  
12. Add another screw. so that each corner is attached with two screws in the front.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0586.JPG">](Large/IMG_0586.JPG)  
13. Press the frame sides flush against the panel, put two more screws in on each side, this time on the side of the panel.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0587.JPG">](Large/IMG_0587.JPG) 
[<img src="Prev/IMG_0588.JPG">](Large/IMG_0588.JPG)   
14. Put your frame piece flat on the table and align the last 450mm panel with open edge of the frame. (Opposite the panel you recently attached.)  
15. Keeping it aligned, drill, countersink, and add a screw on the inside corner of the panel. Be careful not to drill through both panels into your table. Repeat this on the other side of the frame.  
16. Add two more screws as shown.  

**TIP:** You can add tape to keep the panels in position. Additionally you can use some masking tape to on your drill, if you have not a distance piece on your drill, to keep the drill deepth. Plan your drilling ahead to avoid the trouble of overlapping screws! You need to keep the position of the Z-axis top brackets in mind!

#Software Setup
##Tools needed:
Brain  

##Parts:
USB cable  
[Marlin 3D Printer Firmware](https://github.com/ErikZalm/Marlin)  
[Arduino Software](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software)  
[Printrun](https://github.com/kliment/Printrun)  
[Slic3r](http://slic3r.org)  

##To Do:
1. Follow the links and load down the software for your OS.  
2. First you need to flash your electronics with the right firmware. Therefore you need Marlin and the Arduino software for the flashing.  
3. When you have installed the software, use the usb cable and connect the printer with your PC. You should now see a green LED flashing on your electronics.  
4. Start the arduino software.  
5. Click „File“ in the menu and chose „Open“. Search the directory of your unzipped firmware and select the file „Configuration.h“.  
6. Under „Tools/Board“ „Arduino Mega 2560 or Mega ADK“ must be selected.  
7. Chose the right serial port under „Tools/Serial port“.  
8. Then choose „File/Upload“. The frimware will now be uploaded to your electronics.  
9. You will get the the message „Upload complete“, if everything works fine.

Installed Printrun (Installing printrun means simply unzipping the file into a folder.)  

##To Do:
1. Start printrun and turn on the power supply of the printer. (The extruder and heatbed should be in center position bevor you turn on the power supply!)  
2. Select the port name you are using from the first drop-down, select your baud rate, and hit connect.  
3. Status messages let you know that your printer is properly connected.  
4. Now you can use the manual controls (x+/-, y+/-, z+/-, extrude/reverse) to move extruder and heatbed.  
5. Move each axis +10/-10 and see i fit moves in the right direction  
	* +x = move extruder on x-axis to the right  
	* +y = move the heatbed up to you (away from the y-motor)  
	* +z = move x-axis on the z-axis up  
	* extrude = the small gear (which will grab the filament) should rotate towards you, when you look on the front side of the printer (the side with the z-axis)  
6. If a direction is inverted. Turn off the power supply and attach the motor plug the other way round on the electronics.  

#Set x- and y- endstop
##Tools needed:
Hex wrench  

##Parts:
Printrun  

##To Do:
1. Start printrun and turn on the power supply of the printer.  
2. The y-endstop should be pressed by the printbed plate when the tip of the hotend is over the front edge of the carbon build plate. Take into account the overlap of the paper clips, when you determin the edge postiion because you do not want to drive your hotend into them. Fix the endstop in the appropriate postion.  
3. The x-endstop should be pressed by the extruder carriage when the tip of the hotend is over the edge of the carbon build plate close to the x-motor. Fix the endstop in the appropriate postion.  
4. Bravo you determined the x and y home position.  

#Z-axis leveling and z-endstop
##Tools needed:
Hex wrench  
2 sheets of paper  

##Parts:
Printrun  

##To Do:
1. Put to sheets of paper over the carbon build plate.  
2. Move the extruder over the carbon build plate, so that just the papers fit between the hotend tip and the carbon build plate. Move carefully in small steps!  
3. If your z-axis makes noises or is not moving at all. The x-axis is not on the some height on both z-axis.  
4. Press „Motors off“. And adjust the height difference manually. Hold one of the z-axis threaded rods in position and level the x-axis by rotating the other rod.  
5. Move the hotend tip to all four corners of the carbon build plate. The paper should not be moved at any point by the hotend tip or even worse the hotend tip scratch into the carbon build plate. Adjust the height of the z-axis if necessary.  
6. If you find the right position, move the z-endstop so that it is pressed by the x-motor carriage. This is now you z-home postion.
