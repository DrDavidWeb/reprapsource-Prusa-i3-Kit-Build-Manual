Soldering iron  
Wire cutter  
Wire stripper  
##Parts:  
[<img src="Prev/IMG_0425.jpg">](Large/IMG_0425.jpg)  
Heatbed
Red & black silicone wires (1,5sq mm) (The thick ones in the clear plastic bag.)

##To Do:
[<img src="Prev/IMG_0428.jpg">](Large/IMG_0428.jpg)  
[<img src="Prev/IMG_0429.jpg">](Large/IMG_0429.jpg)  
1. Strip one end of each heatbed cable, twist the strands and tin it. (Strip the other end of each cable and twist the strands only.)  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0434.jpg">](Large/IMG_0434.jpg)  
2. Tin the pads of the heatbed by heating them and applying some solder.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0432.jpg">](Large/IMG_0432.jpg)    
3. To connect the cables, place the cable ends on the tinned pads and apply heat. (Add additional solder if necessary)  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0436.jpg">](Large/IMG_0436.jpg)  
4. Make sure the cable is firmly attached to pad before removing heat. After removing the heat, hold the cable in place as it will take several seconds for the solder to cool.  
5. Put the heatbed aside.

**WARNING:** Do not tin any cables that are screwed to the electronics! This will result in poor connections and is dangerous.

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0471.jpg">](Large/IMG_0471.jpg)  
10. Twist one end of the silicone cable around the exposed part of the power resistor leg and solder it in place. Make sure to make the twist close enough, so that the tubing cannot move.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0472.jpg">](Large/IMG_0472.jpg)  
11. Push the resistor in the hotend.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0473.jpg">](Large/IMG_0473.jpg)  
12. Repeat with the other wire and the other resistor leg.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0482.jpg">](Large/IMG_0482.jpg)  
13. Place the thermistor in the hole at the hotend.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0484.jpg">](Large/IMG_0484.jpg)  
14. Cut off a short strip of kapton and wrap it around each of the solder joints several times.  
15. Use a strip of Kapton to secure the thermistor to the hotend. Wrap around several times, but make sure to keep the nozzle clear. (Do not economise with the Kapton.) It is important, that the thermistor is kept in place!  
16.  Use a Kapton to attach the thermistor legs to the hotend and create a strain-relief by the way.  
17. Bend resistor legs along the body.

#To Do:
[<img src="Prev/IMG_0499.jpg">](Large/IMG_0499.jpg)  
1. Take the four short rods, a ... nut and motor holder and drivetrain.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0501.jpg">](Large/IMG_0501.jpg)  
[<img src="Prev/IMG_0502.jpg">](Large/IMG_0502.jpg)  
2. Push the nut into the nut trap of the drivetrain. (You will not reach this nut trap easily later on.) Through this construction, the drivetrain can be used to adjust the tension oft he Y-axis belt.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0503.jpg">](Large/IMG_0503.jpg)  
3. Slide two of the short rods through M8 sized holes of the Y-axis motor holder.  
4. Slide one rod through the M8 opening of the drivetrain.  
5. Pick 4 M8 nuts and washers.  
6. Slide a washer and a nut on to each side of the motor holder.

8. Slide a washer and a nut on to each side of the drivetrain.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0507.jpg">](Large/IMG_0507.jpg)  
9. Now you need 16 M8 nuts and washers, the corner pieces and the short rods.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0508.jpg">](Large/IMG_0508.jpg)  
10. Attach the corner pieces similar to the motor holder/drivetrain, so that each piece is wrapped in washers and then in nuts. (The upper rod fitting of the corner pieces are open on one side and should face in one direction. For the motor holder the opening should face into the direction of motor connection points.)

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0515.jpg">](Large/IMG_0515.jpg)  
11. Adjust the distance between the corner pieces. 11,5 cm is a good value to go with. It is important to keep the distance exactly even for the two end segements of the  Y-axis you now have created. You want your Y-axis to be square.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0510.jpg">](Large/IMG_0510.jpg)  
12. Take the two long threaded M10 rods, 8 M10 nuts and washers.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0511.jpg">](Large/IMG_0511.jpg)  
13. Slide on a washer, two nuts and a washer from each end of the rod.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0512.jpg">](Large/IMG_0512.jpg)

14. Slide the M10 rods through the bottom holes of motor holder segment and attach them with a washer and a nut.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0518.jpg">](Large/IMG_0518.jpg)  
15. Pick the two smooth rods and slide them in the upper openings of the motor holder segment.

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0519.jpg">](Large/IMG_0519.jpg)  
16. Slide two bearings on rod and one bearing on the other rod.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0525.jpg">](Large/IMG_0525.jpg)  
17. Use to wrenches and tighten all inner and outer nuts against the printed parts. (Make sure to keep the distances you measured.)  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0520.jpg">](Large/IMG_0520.jpg)  
[<img src="Prev/IMG_0521.jpg">](Large/IMG_0521.jpg)  
18. Attach the drivetrain segment on the other side of your rods and slide them in. Attach the threaded rods with a washer and a nut.  
19. Use two bearings, a M4 bolt and nut to attach an idler bearing to the drivetrain. Use a second nut to counter the first nut.  

**WARNING:** The smooth rods sit pretty tight in their openings an it is important to slide them in. Do not push them in from the top! This could damage the printed partrs seriously.

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0533.jpg">](Large/IMG_0533.jpg)  
2. Use the scrapwood as base and drill through all 4 corner holes of the heatbed and the wooden plate.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0534.jpg">](Large/IMG_0534.jpg)  
3. Remove the clamps and mark the direction in which the heatbed cables pointed when you drilled the holes.  

[BILD FEHLT!)  
4. Turn the wooden plate upside down. You know see the rough side (bottom). Use a ruler to mark the middle of the plate and draw a line. (Your marking for the cables should be on the left side of the ruler)  
5. Without lifting the ruler, make a mark at 112mm from the edge, and another mark at 20mm from the edge.  
6. Position your ruler on the 20mm mark, and draw a line parallel to the edge of the square plate.  

**TIP:** It is possible to get the wooden parts, with different coatings or even without. We usually deliver dark coated wood, because it looks the nicest. But feel to use what you like. To make it easy to mark the wood with a pencil, put some masking tape on it.  

#Attach printbed to Y-Axis

#Frame assembly
##Tools needed:
Screwdriver  
3 or (better) 3,2 mm drill bit and drill  
Countersink bit  
(Optional) second drill or power screwdriver (Makes working much easier, because you do not have to change the bits all the time)  
pencil or other marker  
overview and the helping hands of a friend, if available are suggested  
3 mm spacer (f.e. I used a cutting mat. Or you can use a couple of M4 nuts, there are enough in the kit.)  

##Parts:
[<img src="Prev/IMG_0575.jpg">](Large/IMG_0575.jpg)  
6 x 450 mm wood panels (IMPORTANT: Put the longer panel away to not mix up the panels. You will need it later.)  
... x 20mm wood screws  

##To Do:
[<img src="Prev/IMG_0576.jpg">](Large/IMG_0576.jpg)  
1. Take two of the 450mm panels and put them edge to edge on a flat surface, forming a corner.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0577.jpg">](Large/IMG_0577.jpg)  
2. Have a friend or a clamp hold them in place and drill through one into the center of the other, about 2.5cm (1 in) from the end.  
3. Make super-sure the panels line up when you drill.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0578.jpg">](Large/IMG_0578.jpg)  
4. Countersink the hole on the flat side and add a screw. Make sure the edges line up.  
5. Repeat on the other end, again about 2.5cm (1 in) from the edge and in the middle.  
6. Take a second pair of panels and repeat step 1-5.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0579.jpg">](Large/IMG_0579.jpg)  
7. Well done - you finished both sides of the frame  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0583.jpg">](Large/IMG_0583.jpg)  
8. Orient the two sides so that the screws point TO THE SIDE in both panels.  
9. Place the corners approximately 450mm apart (inside to inside) and place a 3mm spacer in each one.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0584.jpg">](Large/IMG_0584.jpg)  
10. Place a 450mm panel between them. (This will be the bottom of the frame.)  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0585.jpg">](Large/IMG_0585.jpg)  
11. Drill into the middle of the panel from the front, countersink and add a screw. Make sure the spacers don't move around when you drill. You want the bottom panel to be  flat and 3mm off the table.  
12. Add another screw. so that each corner is attached with two screws in the front.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0586.jpg">](Large/IMG_0586.jpg)  
13. Press the frame sides flush against the panel, put two more screws in on each side, this time on the side of the panel.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0587.jpg">](Large/IMG_0587.jpg) 
[<img src="Prev/IMG_0588.jpg">](Large/IMG_0588.jpg)   
14. Put your frame piece flat on the table and align the last 450mm panel with open edge of the frame. (Opposite the panel you recently attached.)  
15. Keeping it aligned, drill, countersink, and add a screw on the inside corner of the panel. Be careful not to drill through both panels into your table. Repeat this on the other side of the frame.  
16. Add two more screws as shown.  

**TIP:** You can add tape to keep the panels in position. Additionally you can use some masking tape to on your drill, if you have not a distance piece on your drill, to keep the drill deepth. Plan your drilling ahead to avoid the trouble of overlapping screws! You need to keep the position of the Z-axis top brackets in mind!

##To Do:
1. Start printrun and turn on the power supply of the printer. (The extruder and heatbed should be in center position bevor you turn on the power supply!) 
2. Select the port name you are using from the first drop-down, select your baud rate, and hit connect.
3. Status messages let you know that your printer is properly connected.
4. Now you can use the manual controls (x+/-, y+/-, z+/-, extrude/reverse) to move extruder and heatbed.
5. Move each axis +10/-10 and see i fit moves in the right direction
	* +x = move extruder on x-axis to the right
	* +y = move the heatbed up to you (away from the y-motor)
	* +z = move x-axis on the z-axis up
	* extrude = the small gear (which will grab the filament) should rotate towards you, when you look on the front side of the printer (the side with the z-axis)
6. If a direction is inverted. Turn off the power supply and attach the motor plug the other way round on the electronics.
